# üéì Image Classification with ResNet (PyTorch) and CatBoost

This repository contains two complementary machine learning projects developed for a university coursework ‚Äî both focusing on **image classification** using different approaches:

- One project uses **deep learning with ResNet architecture in PyTorch**.
- The other project applies **CatBoost (gradient boosting)** on **image features converted to tabular format**.

By comparing deep learning and gradient boosting approaches for the same image classification task, this project highlights the strengths and trade-offs of each method.
